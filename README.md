Tunic Manual Translation
========================

This is a tool I developed to help me translate the game manual for the
[Tunic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunic_(video_game)) video game, which
is written in a mix of English and a constructed language.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you plan to play Tunic in the future please stop reading immediately,
> this manual contains major spoilers about pretty much the whole game.


## Usage

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/);
2. Run `npm start`;
3. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ with a web browser.
